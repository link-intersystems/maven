 * A {@link Goal} represents a specific task within a build process that can be

 * configured. Thus each {@link Goal} only takes a specific PARAMS object. This
 * might be an interface that is adapted by a maven mojo, but since it is not
 * tied to a {@link Mojo} it can be easily invoked by other components in a
 * maven build, e.g. other {@link Mojo}s.
